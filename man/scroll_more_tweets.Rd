\description{
Function takes remote driver currently at a Twitter users' stream,
     and scrolls till no more new tweets, replies, quotes, etc.
     are loaded (i.e., until the "Back to top â†‘" icon is displayed).
     It then extracts all tweet IDs from the HTML source (tag 'div.tweet', attribute 'data-item-id'),
     and returns them as a character vector.
}
\section{Scroll sleep}{

   Argument \code{sleep} determines how much the Twitter timeline has to fully load.
   \bold{WARNING}: Setting low values (<.75 seconds) endangers not getting all tweet IDs,
   as the scraping process can be aborted prematurely due to too little scroll sleep.
   The default setting of .75 seconds is a minumum with fast internet connection.
}

\section{WARNING}{

    Function presuposses an active remote Selenium driver.
